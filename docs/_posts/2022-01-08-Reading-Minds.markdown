<p>When people say random things, they’re never truly random. There is always some invisible thought process that was carried out behind the scenes. In the following passage, Sherlock has followed the invisible thread and pipes in knowing exactly what Watson has been thinking about:</p>

<p>Now, I have three theories that I find intriguing. Two of them are highly dubious, but one of them was done in a contest setting and correctly guessing the author’s thought process was exceedingly helpful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="how-newton-really-came-up-with-gravity">How Newton Really Came Up With Gravity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first theory is about how Newton came up with gravity. Everyone knows the story of Newton sitting under an apple tree when the apple falls and bonks his head, and “Eureka!” he figures out that gravity pulls the apple. There’s another, more credible account found in Newton's biography, "Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life" by William Stukeley, which says that</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden and drank tea, under the shade of some apple trees…he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought to himself…”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I have another theory. Imagine this: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Newton is lying down under an apple tree, staring up at a juicy red apple. He wants to get the apple, but doesn’t want to climb up the tree to pick it himself. So he pretends to pull it, somehow applying Force through the medium of the air. Suddenly, the apple falls! Newton has a brief moment where he thinks that he magically pulled the apple down, but this is clearly impossible. Still, he knows that some force must have acted on the apple, and while lying on his back he turns around to see what else could have applied the force. And what was the only thing behind him at the time? The Earth. Thus, the only logical conclusion was that the Earth pulled the apple, and the theory of gravity was born.</p><cite>My theory of how Newton actually came up with the theory of gravity.</cite></blockquote>

<h2 id="usa-tstst-5">USA TSTST/5</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, you may think that this is ridiculous and a waste of time, but it came in clutch in TSTST 2021. On Day 2, the second problem stated:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Let T be a tree on n vertices with exactly k leaves. Suppose that there exists a subset of at least (n+k-1)/2 vertices of T, no two of which are adjacent. Show that the longest path in T contains an even number of edges. (A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. A leaf is a vertex of degree 1.)</p><cite>https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2582544_2021_usa_tstst</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This problem ended up being very philosophical, and I managed to solve it based on a few meta observations. The first was that (n+k-1)/2 was likely an upper bound, because if it weren’t, then it would not play well with the parity-based conditions. Then, as I tried to prove that this was an upper bound, I noticed that describing the equality case was incredibly weird, and so 1 hour into the problem I had found the morally correct characterisation. This reformulated problem was "Find the equality case of the inequality f(T)&lt;=(n+k-1)/2, where f(T) is the size of the maximum subset of T which contains no edges”. Then, as a side effect, we will hopefully find that the distance between each pair of edges is even. Importantly though, this is not what we are actually trying to show, the more important thing is to first fully characterize the equality case.</p>

<h2 id="the-three-body-problem-trisolaris-is-china">The Three Body Problem - Trisolaris is China</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This sections contains mild spoilers about The Three Body Problem, obviously.&nbsp;This theory will also not be particularly interesting if you have not read the book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I have a theory that in the Three Body Problem (TBP), Trisolaris represents China. It would be amazing if Liu Cixin actually wrote TBP as political commentary, and the true message was so well concealed that it went over the heads of both the censors and a majority of the audience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like to imagine that he wrote TBP while having Humanity represent the West and Trisolarans represent China. Even if he did not, assuming that it is true adds another layer of rich political commentary to this already amazing novel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trisolaris’ origin story of a civilization constantly stuck in a cycle of death and rebirth too closely resembles Chinese dynastic cycles to be a coincidence. For that reason, I believe that Liu Cixin set out to create an alien civilization that emulated Chinese civilization. One of the biggest ideas in TBP, mentioned in the very title, is the three body system representing the three stars of the Alpha Centauri system which Trisolaris’ home world orbits. I reckon that he chose this chaotic system as a way to create a cyclic civilization that would turn Trisolaris into an unmistakable symbol of China.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nathan N. also mentions that the political systems line up. Earth is portrayed as being inefficient, materialistic, yet politically free, just like the West. On the other hand, Trisolaris is organized, efficient, and irreverent towards human rights, just like China.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This kind of thinking, guessing what the author is thinking, is a useful exercise that brings forth fascinating insights. Each of these examples individually brought me great joy when I discovered them: the Newton example is funny, the TSTST example gave me an extra 7 points towards making TST group, and the Three Body Problem example is highly dubious but absolutely fascinating. This blog post also hopefully points out that when people rapidly switch topics, if you're keen enough you can find the underlying connection. Still, this has really just been a collection of three theory stories that I made up and find interesting, and I hope you enjoyed reading them.</p>
