Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang and I'm a member of the MIT Class of 2027.

My primary intellectual background is in mathematics, where I was ~15-20th in USAMO and US IMO Team Selection Tests, and computer science (mainly networks) where I've been published in IEEE and ACM and am working at CERN this summer.

Beyond that, my passionate distraction from the above topics is compulsively buying books from used book stores, where I love reading history, sci-fi, politics, linguistics, politics, and seek to devour as many books as possible (goodreads.com/ryanyang).

Outside of these things, I love crossword fencing, baseball sabermetrics, skateboarding, dressing formally for no reason, the NYTimes, Home Depot, and, of course, my gallon-jug water bottle.
