    <p> Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang.     
       
        In high school, I was a nationally ranked math Olympian and was a 
        member of the 30-person TST group for the 2022 USA IMO team. 
        Recently, I have led international research projects; 
        in 2021, I lead and was a first author of a seminal work 
         in nonlinear-averaging synchronization protocols published in IEEE 
         MILCOM2022; 
         in 2022, I worked as a lead designer in a Yale team 
         designing the next-generation CERN-FTS4 which will soon control all 
         of CERN's, and the rest of data-intensive sciences', data replication.
        
        I love hopping onto research projects, and feel free to reach out to me at
        y.ryan.yang@gmail.com or yim#5288 on Discord!
