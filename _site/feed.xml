I’m nowhere near that creative.</p>

<p>Rather, there are literally 2048 different, technically distinct orientations of a rubik’s cube that “solve” the puzzle and are visually correct, but are nevertheless different.</p>

<p>Namely, if you draw an arrow on each sticker of the rubik’s cube to keep track of its position, you can track the precise orientation of each of the pieces. In a perfectly solved cube, each of the edge and corner stickers are perfectly fixed because they have to be oriented to be adjacent to a specified other side. But! The center faces actually have no such requirement, and are free (ish) to move.</p>

<p>Thus, in theory, there are a total of 4^6 different orientations: each of the centers has four different orientations, and there are six centers. However the real number ends up being half of this: 2048.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-there-are-at-most-2048--12--46-orientations">Part 1: There are at most 2048 = 1/2 * 4^6 orientations</h2>
<p>Let \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) be the set {0,1,2,3} taken mod 4. Thus, the orientation of the set of six centers is a 6d vector, where each value is a number in {0,1,2,3}, with the assumption that (0,0,0,0,0,0) is our baseline solution.</p>

<p>Then, to demonstrate \(\leq 2048\), we claim that it must be true that the sum of the orientations of each of the faces must be invariant mod 180 degrees, or the sum of the values in \((\{0,1,2,3\})^6\) are 0 mod 2. This is equivalent to saying that any sequences of moves that sends a color-solved rubik’s cube back to itself must have an even number of moves, where each move is a 90 degree rotation of one face.</p>

<p>Inspired by Cayley’s Theorem, we consider every action to be a permutation of S_54, the group reorienting the (6 faces) * (9 stickers/face) = 54 stickers.</p>

<p>For reasons known to literature, each “move” is an “odd” permutation since it is composed of five 4-cycles. Then, in order to get back to the identity, which is even, there must have been an even number of cycles (otherwise odd times odd would’ve been even).</p>

<h2 id="part-2-all-2048-orientations-with-even-total-sum-can-be-achieved">Part 2: All 2048 orientations with even total sum can be achieved.</h2>

<p>To show this, we demonstrate two possible sequences of moves that achieve:</p>

<p>Type A, (2,0,0,0,0,0):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Namely, there is a sequence of moves that rotates one face 180 degrees: 5x (R, U, R’, U). - Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rubiks_Cubes/comments/kduwle/comment/gg008h2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</li>
</ul>

<p>Type B, (1,-1,0,0,0,0):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Namely, there exists a sequence of moves that rotates one face 90 degrees cw, and an adjacent face 90 degrees ccw.</li>
  <li>Source: http://tilde.club/~notfire/cube/3x3x3_x_rotating_centres.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>We claim that this forms a basis of all even-sum elements in the set {0,1,2,3 mod 4}^6. Type A moves reduce the problem to just handling {0,1}, and then if X and Y are a pair of opposite sides, with the other four being A, B, C, D, then the following five Type B moves are linearly independent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XA, XB, XC, XD, YA</li>
</ul>

<p>This covers all 32 even-sum vectors in \(\{0,1\}^6\), since:</p>

<ul>
  <li>orientation of Y determines number of YAs.</li>
  <li>orientation of A, B,C,D then determine numbers of XA, XB,XC,XDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, (2,0,0,0,0,0) and (1,-1,0,0,0,0) cover all even sum elements of \(\{0,1,2,3\}^6\).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, it is possible to rotate the center faces by a cumulative even number of 90-degree turns, for a total of 2048 ways to solve a Rubik’s cube.</p>

<p>Remarkably, I can not find any reference to this on the internet. The idea here is mainly just the pairing of the two known-ish ideas of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>even number of moves implying multiple of 180 net center</li>
  <li>the known center shifting algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>into a tight/precise full characterization of reachable center-orientation systems.</p>

<p>And for some reason, I couldn’t find ANY news coverage explaining this? So, I set out to solve this mystery on my own, and here are the results of my internet sleuthing:</p>

<p>(pre-TLDR; low confidence that maybe phosphorus/obesity somehow affects baby gender or the @cia messed up their data, with a nice Covid epilogue)</p>

<p><strong>I: Historical Context</strong></p>

<p>Nauru is an island in Oceania approximately halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Previously mostly ignored by Europe, in 1899, high-grade phosphate ore was discovered in Nauru [1]. Occupied in sequence by Germany, Australia, and Japan, Nauru finally gained independence in 1968 after having been stripped of 35 trillion metric tons of phosphate.</p>

<p><strong>II: Biology: a la Alec Jones and “the water’s turning the frogs gay.”</strong></p>

<p>Due to the destruction of the natural land, 90% of the food in Nauru is imported [2], and Nauru has a 61% prevalence of obesity, the highest in the world (USA has 36.2%) [3].</p>

<p>It’s known that the environment can have an impact on the sex ratio of births. For turtles, gender is determined by temperature during incubation. More relevantly, male billionaires have an incredible 2X more sons than daughters [4].</p>

<p>Thus, it’s <em>possible</em> that the literal presence of phosphorus, or more likely the obesity epidemic that came as an aftereffect of environmental degradation, may have had an effect on the sex ratio.</p>

<p>Frustratingly, social scientists have not done any research into the effect of obesity on at-birth sex ratios, despite the insane coincidence that the country with the lowest at-birth sex ratio also has the highest rates of obesity.</p>

<p>Or maybe it’s just bad data?</p>

<p><strong>III: The CIA World Factbook</strong></p>

<p>The ratio over time (by default m/f) has been:
2013 Nauru Bureau of Stats*: 193/173=1.11 [5]
2017 CIA Factbook: 0.83 [6]
2020 CIA Factbook: 0.84 [7]
2022 CIA Factbook: 1.04 [8]</p>

<p>Weird in 2017/2020, but back to normal in 2022?</p>

<p>The sample size is small, but not <em>that</em> small. At ~300 births a year, each of the individual 2017 and 2020 sex ratios has a p-value of ~0.04, and damningly, the 0-14 age block also had a 0.79 ratio with 1337 males to 1684 females.</p>

<p>Additionally, it’s almost literally impossible to reconcile the change in the 0-14 block from the 2020 and 2022 data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0.84-&gt;1.04 (at birth)</li>
  <li>0.79 -&gt; 1.04 (0-14 block)</li>
  <li>0.85 -&gt; 0.91 (15-24)
without massive changes in measured populations due to something like, say, a pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IV: A Clue: Covid?</strong></p>

<p>I came across Nauru’s notable at-birth sex-ratio back in 2021 and was hopeful that the return to normal in 2022 could explain this mystery.</p>

<p>It sort of does. On one hand, the return to a 1:1 ratio in the 0-14 and 15-24 blocks are explainable by Covid. New Zealand and Australia, popular places for Nauru residents to find employment, enforced strict Covid bubbles, likely forcing the mostly male migrant workers to stay in Nauru, restoring the ratio.</p>

<p>But the at-birth sex ratio is not solved by COVID at all???? It’s <em>supposed</em> to be 50:50 no matter what, with my only ideas being:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CIA collected bad data in 2017/2020 and didn’t bother sanity-checking the insane 0.84 at-birth sex ratio.</li>
  <li>Related to the previous, but maybe a small group of Nauru people have been hiding their boys from the CIA?</li>
  <li>Nauru people do ultrasounds pre-pregnancy and travel to the mainland for the births of the, generally larger, male babies.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>V: Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Recap: Nauru’s natural landscape got messed up. Health and environment can affect gender, and Nauru’s environment and health were seriously affected by phosphorus mining. While COVID explains the sex ratio in the 0-14 block, the at-birth sex ratio should not be affected, but it nevertheless jumped significantly from 2017/2020 to 2022, rising from ~0.8 to ~1.</p>

<p>My plan is now to reach out to Nauru officials to see if they know anything, but any help in solving the following still-open problems would be greatly appreciated:</p>

<p>1) Could obesity rates actually cause such a big change in the at-birth sex ratio?
2) Are there any COVID-era changes that could affect the at-birth sex ratio, such as an increase in the survival rate of Nauru baby boys?
3) What are the CIA Handbook’s data-collection policies, and is it possible that they forgot to sanity-check the Nauru numbers?</p>

<p>“The sheer quantity of brain power that hurled itself voluntarily and quixotically into the search for new baseball knowledge was either exhilarating or depressing, depending on how you felt about baseball. The same intellectual resources might have cured the common cold, or put a man on Pluto.”</p>

<p>“One absolutely cannot tell, by watching, the difference between a .300 hitter and a .275 hitter. The difference is one hit every two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Baseball is a soap opera that lends itself to probabilistic thinking. [Dick Cramer]”</p>

<p>“Anti-intellectual resentment is common in all of American life and it has many diverse expressions. Refusing to draft college players might have been one of them.</p>

<p>“What baseball managers did do, on occasion, beginning in the early 1980s, was hire some guy who knew how to switch on the computer. But they did this less with honest curiosity than in the spirit of a beleaguered visitor to Morocco hiring a tour guide: pay off one so that the seventy-five others will stop trying to trade you their camels for your wife. Which one you pay off is largely irrelevant.”</p>

<p>“For a lot of the players it was their first exposure to the Southern female - the most flagrant cheater in the mutual disarmament pact known as feminism. Lipstick! Hairdos! Submissiveness!”</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to put together a reference document, tentatively named “Practical Convex Optimization,” that can act as a bit of prologue and/or reference document for work I’ve done in optimization theory. This has turned out to be a far larger endeavor than I expected, but here’s a draft: 
<img src="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxvvjwbmsvgw" alt="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxvvjwbmsvgw" /></p>

<h2 id="upcoming-week">Upcoming Week</h2>

<p>For some reason, my to-do list has a massive bulge in the 2/14-216 period. It’s some sort of weird magnet for things to handle that defies logic – @RogerPenrose you might want to take a look at this, could inspire a new physics or something.</p>

<p>There’s some human things</p>
<ul>
  <li>A couple of election statements</li>
  <li>A prefect application</li>
  <li>A school meeting announcement for a Wordle Tournament (!)</li>
  <li>Valentine’s Day</li>
</ul>

<p>But then there’s also the F=ma and AIME. By some unlucky coincidence, Choate is doing both the F=ma B and AIME 2, which means that they’re on back to back days.</p>

<p>This is technically pretty likely – both {A &amp; 1} and {B &amp; 2} cause this to happen – but I feel like most schools are doing {B &amp; 1} which is significantly nicer.</p>

<h2 id="aime-and-how-the-imo-tst-process-works">AIME and how the IMO TST Process Works</h2>
<p>AIME is terrifying because it’s the first of two make-or-break contests, the second being USAMO 2022, for entering the TST process for IMO 2023.</p>

<p>The IMO TST process is complicated, see <a href="https://blog.evanchen.cc/2020/11/10/usa-special-team-selection-test-series-for-imo-2021/">Evan Chen’s Explanation of the 2021 IMO TST</a>. This year it’s also slightly different because of Covid, so perhaps there is some value in me writing an explanation of this year’s process too because the only people who understand it seem to be the people who have qualified for the process and learn it by doing it.</p>

<p>Regardless, the AIME is pretty damn important if I want to make the IMO. I need a 11 out of 15 to be safe (which would give a 240.5 USAMO index). This should be fine since I got a 14 last year – but I also spent a large chunk of my winter last year vibing to music and math.</p>

<h2 id="fma">F=ma</h2>
<p>As for F=ma, I probably won’t prep too much, maybe one or two practice sets. I qualified last year by the slimmest of margins, getting exactly the cutoff score only after they accepted a second answer for a broken problem. I don’t have high hopes for F=ma, but I’ll probably try to make time because a second USAPhO qualification would be pretty cool. Still, I care <em>much</em> more about qualifying for USAMO because I can actually do well on USAMO, not so much for USAPhO.</p>

However, since we uploaded to Arxiv at 10pm on Friday, and the verification process is slower over the weekends, I still don’t have a nice arxiv link to put in the post.</p>

<p>More importantly though, Wordpress doesn’t have LaTeX functionality, which makes any attempt at explaining math beyond arithmetic an extremely painful endeavor…</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to write a Life Update, the second half of which will kinda be about the paper because it was <em>the</em> thing that I worked on and thought about in the week before the Jan 27 (AOE midnight) deadline.</p>

<p>I’ve also set up a mailing list, so if you enter your email into the “subscribe to our newsletter” form on the main page I’ll email you each time I post.</p>

<h2 id="week-3-sun-116---sat-122">Week 3: Sun 1/16 - Sat 1/22</h2>
<p>Hours: 9:40 (U), 10:00 (M), 9:30 (T), 12:35 (W), 10:00 (R), 13:00 (F), 10:10 (S)</p>

<p>For the first half of the week, I was still somewhat recovering from getting sick (which you can read about it in my previous life update). The period from Monday to Thursday was a delightful return to normal. After being sick for a week, and suffering through the accompanied decrease in quality of life, it was amazing being back to normal. I promised myself that I would appreciate my regained health, and I did. All in all, I lost ten pounds (mostly water) through the process. However, getting sick was a net positive on my mental health (?). It was a forced break where I didn’t think about complicated things – I thought a lot about god and pain.</p>

<p>Beginning on Friday though, the ICML paper grind began. It’s amazing how the days can be filled up; that day, I went to my Friday classes, winter rowing, ran physics club, made an amazing poster w/ Deven Huang, and then spent the rest of the night trying to solve the fact that I did not have a full convergence proof for our ICML submission.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the only thing I did was work on the paper, and this mainly took the form of me rereading papers. Throughout the entire process, I mainly referenced three papers, and I’ll reveal them in my full post about the paper. :)</p>

<h2 id="week-4-sun-123---sat-129">Week 4: Sun 1/23 - Sat 1/29</h2>
<p>Hours: 10:00 (U), 14:20 (M), 12:00 (T), 13:30 (W), 13:35 (R), 9:10 (F), 8:30 (S)</p>

<p>There are very few times in my logs when I was not-resting for more than 14 hours. Those were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2/18/2021 (14:30): Making my first ever podcast</li>
  <li>3/1/2020 (14:00): Doing a USACO on a Monday</li>
  <li>6/17/2021 (14:40): Taking AP CSA and then an official MOP Mock IMO, with Greenish in the afternoon</li>
</ul>

<p>Hitting 14 hours is a momentous occasion. After all, 14 hours + 8 hours of sleep + 3 hours of life essentials requires 100% efficiency plus a little extra.</p>

<p>The period from Monday to Thursday when I made the most progress on the paper. I made an observation that put me in the right direction on Thursday at 10:30am while in Physics class, and then made the crucial observation at around 11:30am while in a SAC study room with DH. Thankfully, by some miracle, I didn’t have too much homework this week. Or maybe since I was sleeping less and had on average 13 hours of working time on my hands each day the homework load seemed really light.</p>

<p>I also think that I’ve mastered the art of handling midnight AOE times as an East coast person. Thursday at 11:59pm in AOE time is equal to Friday at 7am in EST time, so the technique I’ve used in my past two paper deadlines is to sleep from ~2:30 AM - ~5:00 AM. This is the perfect timing because you get a long block of time until 2:30 AM, and then wake up with a fresh mind, sync up with your collaborators, and then do a final 1.5 hours of grammar checking and higher quality edits since you’re slightly less sleep-deprived.</p>

<p>On Friday after submitting at 7am, I slept from 7:00-8:30 since I didn’t have classes until 9:20 AM. I got through classes and sports with only one person, HD, remarking about me looking tired, which I think is a great endorsement of the 2:45am - 5:15am nap as opposed to a full all-nighter. I took Friday night off, watched movies with C, went to the Lunar Banquet, and got home to Easton around 10pm, where I worked on the Arxiv version until 12:30am and then went to sleep. I slept in until noon on Saturday.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>While I lucked out and there wasn’t too much homework last week, God’s compensating for that this week.</p>

<p>I have</p>
<ul>
  <li>a presentation on the Froude number</li>
  <li>a history essay</li>
  <li>an English essay</li>
  <li>a personal narrative for my college counselor.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pretty excited though, if I can stay as efficient as I was in the week before the ICML deadline, I should be able to handle everything. Contestwise, I skipped USACO this weekend because I just didn’t have enough time, and AIME is terrifyingly only two weeks away.</p>

<p>Remarkably, this post only took 1 hour, and I really should get back to homework.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update," /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I originally planned on writing out a full explanation of the research in the paper that we submitted to ICML last Friday.

<hr />

<p>The Gale-Shapley Algorithm is one of a select few algorithms that managed to work its way into the popular collective conscious. This is largely due to the fact that it’s both</p>
<ul>
  <li>a real algorithm which genuinely solves the Stable Marriage Problem in near optimal time,</li>
  <li>and a good model for real life dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t really care that Gale-Shapley is fast (it’s used for med school residency assignment), but I mainly think that the analysis of the algorithm, and the proof of why it works, is <em>fascinating</em>.</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement-stable-matching">Problem Statement: Stable Matching</h2>
<p>The problem the algorithm solves is finding a “stable matching” between two groups of participants of equal size, \(N\) men and \(N\) women. Every single person has, in their head, some set of preferences, and ranks the \(N\) people from the other group from 1st to Nth.</p>

<p>Firstly, a matching is a set of pairs \(\{(A_1,B_1),\ldots, (A_n, B_n)\}\) where each \((A,B)\) pair is a couple. A stable matching is a matching where there is no threat of eloping – what this means is that there is no pair \(A_i\) and \(B_j\) where \((A_i,B_j)\) would both be happier if they ditched their current partners and got together with each other (formally, for no \((i,j)\) do we have that \(A_i\) prefers \(B_j\) to \(B_i\) and \(B_j\) prefers \(A_i\) to \(A_j\)).</p>

<h2 id="gale-shapley-algorithm">Gale-Shapley Algorithm</h2>
<p>The preferences are all collected and saved. People will either be “single” or “engaged”, but everyone starts off as being “single”. Men will also remember who they have asked out (so as to never ask them out again). Then, the algorithm is</p>
<ul>
  <li>As long as there are still single people, we do a two-part round of proposals:
    <ul>
      <li>Firstly, each single guy surveys the women who have not rejected him, and proposes to his favorite one (regardless if she is engaged or not).</li>
      <li>Secondly, each girl considers her fiance, as well as her new proposals, and chooses her favorite amongst these men.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-on-algorithm-behavior">Notes on Algorithm Behavior</h2>
<p><strong>Everyone Gets a Partner:</strong> If there are still single people left, there must a single man and a single woman. The woman must never have been asked out, and the single man must have asked out every women, which is a contradiction.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do Men Only Try Once?:</strong> Men will only try once because, in the eyes of the woman, the quality of her partner will only ever increase. Thus, if the man was rejected once, even if she has a new partner, by transitivity, she prefers her new partner to her old partner to the rejected man.</p>

<p><strong>Speed:</strong> This algorithm will always terminate relatively quickly. In fact, it will always terminate within \(N\) proposal rounds since the action is initiated by guys, and each guy will only ask each of the \(N\) women at most once. Each round has computational cost \(N\), for a total of \(O(N^2)\). This is an optimal dependency on \(N\) since the input size of the preferences is \((2*N) * N\) which is also \(O(N^2)\).</p>

<p><strong>Stable Matching:</strong> Lastly, of course, we want to verify that we have indeed found a stable matching. Gale-Shapley yields a stable match because every man who wants to elope has already been rejected by every woman who he would be willing to elope with.</p>

<h2 id="where-this-algorithm-is-applied">Where This Algorithm is Applied</h2>
<p>These exists in</p>
<ul>
  <li>Med School Residency Program</li>
  <li>Load Balancing in Distributed Computer Systems (UCSB)</li>
  <li>Matching Drivers and Riders in Ridesharing Platform (UCSB)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-lattice-of-stable-matchings">The lattice of stable matchings</h2>
<p>An important characteristic of the stable matching problem is that it’s not unique. At least one stable matching exists (by construction through Gale-Shapley), but there is in fact a whole lattice of stable matchings. It then turns out that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theorem 2.4 For every preference structure, the matching obtained by the Gale-Shapley algorithm, when the men propose, is optimal for each man. The matching obtained by the Gale-Shapley algorithm, when the women propose, is optimal for each woman. (https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~jrmarden/ewExternalFiles/lecture05-notes.pdf)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="takeaway-1-memetic-evolution-of-social-systems">Takeaway 1: Memetic Evolution of Social Systems</h2>
<p>I think there are two lessons to draw from Gale-Shapley. The first is that models of reality can sometimes create usable algorithms. This occurs in this case because we happen to have pretty good dating social conventions which are reasonably efficient – which makes sense because lots of smart people have thought about and still enjoy thinking about similarly-flavored problems. I suppose in theory our conventions could be even more efficient if we normalized:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guys asking out lots of girls</li>
  <li>Ditching your partner for anyone who’s better</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think optimizing for Gale-Shapley would necessarily be better, largely because</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s designed to minimize computational complexity and have certain nice theoretical results</li>
  <li>lots of effort goes into figuring out the ordering of someone’s preferences as opposed to just doing the matching</li>
  <li>a preference for monogamy precludes the information transfer necessary for everyone to figure out which of the \((7 billion factorial) \approx (10^(10^11))\) possible preference orderings they have.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, most interestingly, I wonder if there was some really smart dude who set up the patriarchy so that guys get the best deal possible.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway-2-agency-matters">Takeaway 2: Agency Matters!</h2>
<p>But the most interesting result, in my opinion, is not the algorithm itself. Rather, it’s the lattice of stable matchings, and the fact that each person on the agentic side <em>gets the best possible result they could possible get in any stable matching</em>.</p>

<p>What this means then is that in all facets of life, whether it’s dating where Gale-Shapley directly translates, or the bigger things in life which are also often about matching people to people, a pretty obvious but surprising easily algorithm is: - figure out what you want, and then ask for it;</p>
<ul>
  <li>if this fails, find the next best option, and ask for that
And, nearly by definition, this will get you the best possible life outcome you could possibly get.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask people out! Shoot your shot! Be Agentic!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member (Groucho Marx)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The flip side of this is that you should be wary of being in a system where you can only say yes/no. And for this reason, one could argue for a Groucho-esque attitude, where you set a default answer of “no” when asked to join some organization/relationship, until you convince yourself that you would’ve independently tried to join the club even if you hadn’t gotten the invite.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway-3-political-structure-why-is-veto-power-so-weak">Takeaway 3: Political Structure: Why is veto power so weak</h2>
<p>Gale-Shapley’s stable-matching lattice is also the nicest explanation I’ve found for why, invariably, the ability to propose legislation is so much more important than the ability to say yes/no. Rome’s Popular Assemblies went this route, as well as several assemblies in the 20th century.</p>

<h2 id="appendixremark-interesting-theory-research">Appendix/Remark: Interesting Theory Research</h2>
<p>Finally, I’d be interested in seeing a characterization of the lattice and algorithms to find intermediate points beyond the extremes that Shapley gets you.</p>

<p><strong>An Algorithm Whose Behavior I’m Curious About:</strong> The main idea is to alternate which side asks every round.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In every round:
    <ul>
      <li>each single person on the asking side proposes to their top choice who satisfies condition X</li>
      <li>each person on the asked side selects their favorite asker</li>
      <li>the asked will then become the askers in the next round, and the askers will become the asked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Candidate Condition X:</strong> Shapley’s Condition X is that “a guy will not ask the same girl twice,” and I think the best alternative here to keep nice properties is “A does not ask out B again until B is dumped.”</p>

<p>This is effectively identical to Shapley, except that the asking side swaps each round, and with a new condition for re-asking out people since getting back with an ex is now possible.</p>

<p><strong>Convergence Properties:</strong> I’m pretty wary about this – I think that it’s unfortunately pretty likely that this will oscillate, and there’s an inherent tradeoff that you make in Condition X between slower convergence and more time to search/find the right matching.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update," /><category term="essay" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“UM.
