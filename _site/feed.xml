I’m nowhere near that creative.</p>

<p>Rather, there are literally 2048 different, technically distinct orientations of a rubik’s cube that “solve” the puzzle and are visually correct, but are nevertheless different.</p>

<p>Namely, if you draw an arrow on each sticker of the rubik’s cube to keep track of its position, you can track the precise orientation of each of the pieces. In a perfectly solved cube, each of the edge and corner stickers are perfectly fixed because they have to be oriented to be adjacent to a specified other side. But! The center faces actually have no such requirement, and are free (ish) to move.</p>

<p>Thus, in theory, there are a total of 4^6 different orientations: each of the centers has four different orientations, and there are six centers. However the real number ends up being half of this: 2048.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-there-are-at-most-2048--12--46-orientations">Part 1: There are at most 2048 = 1/2 * 4^6 orientations</h2>
<p>Let \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) be the set {0,1,2,3} taken mod 4. Thus, the orientation of the set of six centers is a 6d vector, where each value is a number in {0,1,2,3}, with the assumption that (0,0,0,0,0,0) is our baseline solution.</p>

<p>Then, to demonstrate \(\leq 2048\), we claim that it must be true that the sum of the orientations of each of the faces must be invariant mod 180 degrees, or the sum of the values in \((\{0,1,2,3\})^6\) are 0 mod 2. This is equivalent to saying that any sequences of moves that sends a color-solved rubik’s cube back to itself must have an even number of moves, where each move is a 90 degree rotation of one face.</p>

<p>Inspired by Cayley’s Theorem, we consider every action to be a permutation of S_54, the group reorienting the (6 faces) * (9 stickers/face) = 54 stickers.</p>

<p>For reasons known to literature, each “move” is an “odd” permutation since it is composed of five 4-cycles. Then, in order to get back to the identity, which is even, there must have been an even number of cycles (otherwise odd times odd would’ve been even).</p>

<h2 id="part-2-all-2048-orientations-with-even-total-sum-can-be-achieved">Part 2: All 2048 orientations with even total sum can be achieved.</h2>

<p>To show this, we demonstrate two possible sequences of moves that achieve:</p>

<p>Type A, (2,0,0,0,0,0):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Namely, there is a sequence of moves that rotates one face 180 degrees: 5x (R, U, R’, U). - Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rubiks_Cubes/comments/kduwle/comment/gg008h2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</li>
</ul>

<p>Type B, (1,-1,0,0,0,0):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Namely, there exists a sequence of moves that rotates one face 90 degrees cw, and an adjacent face 90 degrees ccw.</li>
  <li>Source: http://tilde.club/~notfire/cube/3x3x3_x_rotating_centres.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>We claim that this forms a basis of all even-sum elements in the set {0,1,2,3 mod 4}^6. Type A moves reduce the problem to just handling {0,1}, and then if X and Y are a pair of opposite sides, with the other four being A, B, C, D, then the following five Type B moves are linearly independent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XA, XB, XC, XD, YA</li>
</ul>

<p>This covers all 32 even-sum vectors in \(\{0,1\}^6\), since:</p>

<ul>
  <li>orientation of Y determines number of YAs.</li>
  <li>orientation of A, B,C,D then determine numbers of XA, XB,XC,XDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, (2,0,0,0,0,0) and (1,-1,0,0,0,0) cover all even sum elements of \(\{0,1,2,3\}^6\).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, it is possible to rotate the center faces by a cumulative even number of 90-degree turns, for a total of 2048 ways to solve a Rubik’s cube.</p>

<p>Remarkably, I can not find any reference to this on the internet. The idea here is mainly just the pairing of the two known-ish ideas of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>even number of moves implying multiple of 180 net center</li>
  <li>the known center shifting algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>into a tight/precise full characterization of reachable center-orientation systems.</p>

<p>In a very well-done piece of data visualization showing the daily schedules of 1000 average Americans from <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/">Flowing Data</a>, one learns that half of all Americans awake by 6:40. At MIT, the median sleep time is around 2-3AM, and attendance at 10AM classes is pretty spotty; average wakeup time is probably around 10:30 to 11:00.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Clearly there’s a generational disconnect here. Explaining why older people wake up around dawn is not too hard. They wake up early because they have to wake up early. But explaining why teenagers nowadays wake up later is much harder, and the oft-quoted “teenagers go to sleep later” due to pubescent hormones only has an effect of one to two hours (cite).</p>

<p>This essay will first discuss the sleep schedules of three time periods of humanity, then explain why our sleep schedules consistently slide later, and finally propose a big-if-true idea of how to fix sleep schedules without needing to rely on alarms and corporate mandates.</p>

<p>We’ll start by estabilishing a structure within which to think about sleep and circadian rhythym. Following in the steps of sleep research, we claim that the only things that really matter and consistently follow a 24-hour cycle are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>light levels</li>
  <li>temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, we will, in order, consider three different kinds of lifestyles.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Early Industrial Society: Light and Heat are both scarce.</li>
  <li>Hunter-Gatherer Society: Heat is more scarce.</li>
  <li>Current Day: Neither are scarce.</li>
</ol>

<p>Important timeline landmarks to have in mind are the sequential occurrences of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>prehistoric: discovery of crude heating through fire</li>
  <li>1883: the invention of the electric thermostat</li>
  <li>1925: half of all homes switch over from gas lights/candles to electric power.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="early-industrial-society">Early Industrial Society</h4>
<p>In early industrial society, work is king. To work your 12-hour shifts, you need to be able to see. But getting light is hard! I mean come on, someone has to go out and slay sea leviathans for their blubber, and they’ll want to be handsomely compensated.</p>

<p>Thus, you need to use all of the available light. This means being awake from dawn to dusk. Then, since the evening is more comfortable, we recover the traditional conceived sleep schedule from like 9PM to dawn.</p>

<h4 id="hunter-gatherers">Hunter Gatherers</h4>

<p>I’ll be mainly referencing a paper by <em>Yetish et al.</em> from 2015 published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01157-4">Cell</a>. Within this study, they aggregated collected sleep data from three Hunter-Gatherer societies: the Tsimane, Hadza, and San. The Tsimane are in South America, and the Hadza and San are in sub-Saharan Africa, with San being the furthest from the equator among all three tribes.</p>

<p>The sleep schedules for all of the tribes <em>broadly</em> goes along the lines of “go to sleep around 3 hours after sunset and wake up around sunrise.” For all tribes, their bed time varies heavily, while their wakeup time remains highly consistent.</p>

<p>The most interesting data comes from the San, the southernmost tribe, who therefore have the largest seasonal shift. While other tribes always awake before dawn, for the San, it’s seasonal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Summer: Awake 1hr after sunrise. Go to sleep at 10:44PM</li>
  <li>Winter: Awaken before sunrise. Go to sleep at 9:16PM.</li>
</ul>

<p>The presence of heat as a relevant variable that changes throughout the year differentiates the San sleep schedule. The other two tribes always awake before dawn, whereas San wake up after sunrise in the summer. Additionally, the San sleep more in the winter than in the summer with the same absolute wakeup time but later bedtime (a heat-dependence that doesn’t exist in modern Western society presumably due to central heating).</p>

<p>Most interestingly, the researchers found that the best way to predict wake up time is with the principle that <strong>“wake onset occurred near the nadir (minimum) of the daily temperature rhythm”</strong>. For context, the general temperature profile of Earth is that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Temperature spikes at Dawn</li>
  <li>Temperature slowly increases afterwards and peaks at 3PM, but is mostly flat from 10AM to 5PM</li>
  <li>Slow, gradual continuous decrease from 5PM to around dawn.</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is why the San wake up later in the summer. Due to the solar schedule, the coldest time of the day gets shifted to after sunrise. An evolutionary explanation for why humans want to wake up when it’s coldest is that we want to be asleep, with its associated decreased core temperature, during the coldest part of the night.</p>

<p>Strikingly, this tells us that in the pristine state of original humanity, the main signal we use for waking up is temperature. This also helps explain why Hunter-Gatherer bedtime varies so much; the temperature decrease at night is relatively continuous and nonabrupt, allowing for high variance in when this signal fully kicks in. A light-dominated sleep-signal would guarantee a consistent bedtime, but the hours-long-delay in melatonin precludes this.</p>

<h3 id="modern-day">Modern Day</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Comfortable modern sleep is an unnatural superstimulus <a href="https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/#comfortable-modern-sleep-is-an-unnatural-superstimulus-sleepiness-just-like-hunger-is-normal">(Alexey Guzey)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what’s up with our current sleep schedules. Well, nowadays, both light and heat are largely held constant, and this ends up applying constant delaying pressure to our circadian rhythym. Recall that the signals we used to rely on were from the 2x2 matrix of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(dawn, temp): the cold bite of pre-dawn</li>
  <li>(dawn, light): bright lights in our eyes</li>
  <li>(dusk, temp): decreasing night temperature</li>
  <li>(dusk, light): hours-delayed melatonin</li>
</ul>

<p>And so essentially, all of these have been disturbed by modern life. Everyone already sorta knows about the light things – we’re not suppose to look at blue lights before going to bed, and sunrise lamps were quite chic a few years ago.</p>

<p>The heat side is an underdiscussed equal partner though. And in fact, as seen with the tribes, their wakeup time was almost entirely determined by subtle temperature changes their bodies sensed at the temperature nadir of the day – even if this meant sometimes awakening before civil dawn in complete darkness and sometimes awakening an hour after sunrise.</p>

<h4 id="actionables">Actionables</h4>

<p>So, just maybe, the way to solve our messed up sleep schedules is temperature? Big if true at the very least.</p>

<p>For the evening, it’s already mostly solved. Anyone who’s thought about sleep knows that getting a special chilled bed or setting the thermostat lowers helps a lot.</p>

<p>But, the truly missing square from the 2x2 matrix of (dawn/dusk, light/temperature) is the <em>temperature at dawn</em> category. Ironically, this was also <strong>the strongest signal in hunter-gatherer sleep schedules</strong> since their bedtimes varied heavily, with the main checkpoint being a consistent wakeup time which was determined by “waking up at the temperature minimum.”</p>

<p>Thus, the main corollary of this systemization of what influences circadian rhythym is that we should experiment with using temperature to wake ourselves up. There’s something to be said about this idea’s similarity with the classic bucket of ice water to the face.</p>

<p>More tastefully though, it would be cool to set a consistent morning alarm where, instead of playing a sound, it would commit a tactical chilling through a smart mattress or a programmed temperature decrease setting in a thermostat.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll build this. But for now, I sleep.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update," /><category term="essay" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bringing Back the Xing-Shi Naming System, or why I changed my last name to Yang-Liu</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/essay/2023/11/16/lastnames.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bringing Back the Xing-Shi Naming System, or why I changed my last name to Yang-Liu" /><published>2023-11-16T19:50:32-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-16T19:50:32-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/essay/2023/11/16/lastnames</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/essay/2023/11/16/lastnames.html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Born too late to be 杨允瑞, born too early to be AE A-XII Yang, yet born just in time to ordain myself Ryan Yang-Liu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an explanation for why I decided to extend my name to Ryan Yang-Liu (and why you should too?).</p>

<p>The Chinese naming system has been bastardized, twice, especially on the English-indexed internet. The saturation ratio of the system, \(\frac{\text{number of people}}{\text{number of names}}\), has skyrocketed to the romanization of chinese last names and usage of common English first names.</p>

<p>The merging of Chinese Names into the romanized system has been a disaster. Chinese first names are two characters, and last names are one character. But when people immigrated, the first names, <em>the place where all of the distinguishing power was</em>, were thrown out, leaving the last name. Ok but at least there are 80,000 characters right? Well that gets compressed down to 1300 pronunciations due to homophone collisions, and then down to 400 different romanized toneless syllables. But, in fact, more than 2x of the information was in the first name because the last names are mostly concentrated into the 100 most common last names (the phrase for “populace” is 老百姓 = 100 most-common-last-names).</p>

<p>And since first names are a matter of cultural familiarity – only someone who’s been a member of the local literati names their kid something like “Russell” or “Sophus” – most Asian-Americans took on the standard American first names, almost all from the top 500 or so names. So, this leaves at most like \(500 * 400 = 200,000\) names (the number of romanization-distinct last names is probably more like 50). And there is virtually no distinguishability left – the informational entropy has been sucked bone-dry.</p>

<p>But naming systems were meant to be injective! Distinguishing power is <em>useful</em>, why else would we have names…  Also, distinctive names keep records and legacies clear – how do you even go about finding someone with a name like “Tony Zhang” based on name alone – and it helps people feel <em>unique</em> and makes the populace seem a bit more distinctive.</p>

<p>So, it’s clear that the Asian-American diaspora must coordinate to solve this problem, which leaves everyone with generic, collision-prone names which give a sense of homogeneity. Luckily, there’s modern historical precedent for solving this problem.</p>

<p>Robust action is possible, for example with Thailand’s Surname Act of 2013. If you know someone from Thailand, they probably have an extremely long (but less than ten characters long) last name. This was done by government mandate, where citizens made up last names which were “required to be unique to a family” (Wikipedia), as an extra layer of protection on top of the government ID system.</p>

<p>However, just making up last names feels wrong. Luckily, there also exists a precedent within the native Chinese system which does not destroy any information and adds distinguishability, namely the Xing-Shi system which existed up until the end of the Western Zhou dynasty. Under this system, all citizens had two last names, one matrilineal and one patrilineal. A child would inherit their 姓 (literally female + birth) from their mother, and their 氏 from their father. This had several nice properties; matrilineal last names are more “certain” because maternity is more certain than paternity, and protects daughters in that the mother needs them to pass down her only family name.</p>

<p>But most importantly, this adds information into the system and helps solve distinguishability.</p>

<p>To do this, I’m boot strapping it by using the European hyphenated double-barrel last name system. So I’m taking Yang (my presumably centuries-old patrilineal name) and Liu (my mom’s maiden name), since unfortunately I can’t trace back my matrilineal lineage very far, and the direct maternal name feels more natural than my grandmother’s last name.</p>

<p>Then, this system can propagate, in that whenever a child is born:</p>
<ul>
  <li>patrilineal name works as normal</li>
  <li>if the mother subscribes to the Xing-Shi system, the child’s matrilineal name matches the mother’s matrilineal name. otherwise, the child’s matrilineal name becomes the mother’s sole (coopted patrilineal) last name.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will do everything in my power to make this propagate. Hopefully this, and a new generation of distinct first names (I like Russell and Sophus as names), will turn the romanized Chinese last name system into something somewhat workable and a bit less broken…</p>

<p>And for some reason, I couldn’t find ANY news coverage explaining this? So, I set out to solve this mystery on my own, and here are the results of my internet sleuthing:</p>

<p>(pre-TLDR; low confidence that maybe phosphorus/obesity somehow affects baby gender or the @cia messed up their data, with a nice Covid epilogue)</p>

<p><strong>I: Historical Context</strong></p>

<p>Nauru is an island in Oceania approximately halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Previously mostly ignored by Europe, in 1899, high-grade phosphate ore was discovered in Nauru [1]. Occupied in sequence by Germany, Australia, and Japan, Nauru finally gained independence in 1968 after having been stripped of 35 trillion metric tons of phosphate.</p>

<p><strong>II: Biology: a la Alec Jones and “the water’s turning the frogs gay.”</strong></p>

<p>Due to the destruction of the natural land, 90% of the food in Nauru is imported [2], and Nauru has a 61% prevalence of obesity, the highest in the world (USA has 36.2%) [3].</p>

<p>It’s known that the environment can have an impact on the sex ratio of births. For turtles, gender is determined by temperature during incubation. More relevantly, male billionaires have an incredible 2X more sons than daughters [4].</p>

<p>Thus, it’s <em>possible</em> that the literal presence of phosphorus, or more likely the obesity epidemic that came as an aftereffect of environmental degradation, may have had an effect on the sex ratio.</p>

<p>Frustratingly, social scientists have not done any research into the effect of obesity on at-birth sex ratios, despite the insane coincidence that the country with the lowest at-birth sex ratio also has the highest rates of obesity.</p>

<p>Or maybe it’s just bad data?</p>

<p><strong>III: The CIA World Factbook</strong></p>

<p>The ratio over time (by default m/f) has been:
2013 Nauru Bureau of Stats*: 193/173=1.11 [5]
2017 CIA Factbook: 0.83 [6]
2020 CIA Factbook: 0.84 [7]
2022 CIA Factbook: 1.04 [8]</p>

<p>Weird in 2017/2020, but back to normal in 2022?</p>

<p>The sample size is small, but not <em>that</em> small. At ~300 births a year, each of the individual 2017 and 2020 sex ratios has a p-value of ~0.04, and damningly, the 0-14 age block also had a 0.79 ratio with 1337 males to 1684 females.</p>

<p>Additionally, it’s almost literally impossible to reconcile the change in the 0-14 block from the 2020 and 2022 data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0.84-&gt;1.04 (at birth)</li>
  <li>0.79 -&gt; 1.04 (0-14 block)</li>
  <li>0.85 -&gt; 0.91 (15-24)
without massive changes in measured populations due to something like, say, a pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IV: A Clue: Covid?</strong></p>

<p>I came across Nauru’s notable at-birth sex-ratio back in 2021 and was hopeful that the return to normal in 2022 could explain this mystery.</p>

<p>It sort of does. On one hand, the return to a 1:1 ratio in the 0-14 and 15-24 blocks are explainable by Covid. New Zealand and Australia, popular places for Nauru residents to find employment, enforced strict Covid bubbles, likely forcing the mostly male migrant workers to stay in Nauru, restoring the ratio.</p>

<p>But the at-birth sex ratio is not solved by COVID at all???? It’s <em>supposed</em> to be 50:50 no matter what, with my only ideas being:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CIA collected bad data in 2017/2020 and didn’t bother sanity-checking the insane 0.84 at-birth sex ratio.</li>
  <li>Related to the previous, but maybe a small group of Nauru people have been hiding their boys from the CIA?</li>
  <li>Nauru people do ultrasounds pre-pregnancy and travel to the mainland for the births of the, generally larger, male babies.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>V: Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Recap: Nauru’s natural landscape got messed up. Health and environment can affect gender, and Nauru’s environment and health were seriously affected by phosphorus mining. While COVID explains the sex ratio in the 0-14 block, the at-birth sex ratio should not be affected, but it nevertheless jumped significantly from 2017/2020 to 2022, rising from ~0.8 to ~1.</p>

<p>My plan is now to reach out to Nauru officials to see if they know anything, but any help in solving the following still-open problems would be greatly appreciated:</p>

<p>1) Could obesity rates actually cause such a big change in the at-birth sex ratio?
2) Are there any COVID-era changes that could affect the at-birth sex ratio, such as an increase in the survival rate of Nauru baby boys?
3) What are the CIA Handbook’s data-collection policies, and is it possible that they forgot to sanity-check the Nauru numbers?</p>

<p>thx for reading!  &lt;3</p>

<p>“The sheer quantity of brain power that hurled itself voluntarily and quixotically into the search for new baseball knowledge was either exhilarating or depressing, depending on how you felt about baseball. The same intellectual resources might have cured the common cold, or put a man on Pluto.”</p>

<p>“One absolutely cannot tell, by watching, the difference between a .300 hitter and a .275 hitter. The difference is one hit every two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Baseball is a soap opera that lends itself to probabilistic thinking. [Dick Cramer]”</p>

<p>“Anti-intellectual resentment is common in all of American life and it has many diverse expressions. Refusing to draft college players might have been one of them.</p>

<p>“What baseball managers did do, on occasion, beginning in the early 1980s, was hire some guy who knew how to switch on the computer. But they did this less with honest curiosity than in the spirit of a beleaguered visitor to Morocco hiring a tour guide: pay off one so that the seventy-five others will stop trying to trade you their camels for your wife. Which one you pay off is largely irrelevant.”</p>

<p>“For a lot of the players it was their first exposure to the Southern female - the most flagrant cheater in the mutual disarmament pact known as feminism. Lipstick! Hairdos! Submissiveness!”</p>

<p>“The author refers to a player’s affected nonchalance and comments he is, “too young to realize you are what you pretend to be.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Moneyball/quotes/ https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/416305-moneyball-the-art-of-winning-an-unfair-game?page=2]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Superbowl</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/potw/2022/02/13/superbowl.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Superbowl" /><published>2022-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/potw/2022/02/13/superbowl</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/potw/2022/02/13/superbowl.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="potw" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Long Weekend</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/news/2022/02/08/Long-Weekend.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Long Weekend" /><published>2022-02-08T19:50:32-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-08T19:50:32-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/news/2022/02/08/Long-Weekend</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/jekyll/update,/news/2022/02/08/Long-Weekend.html"><![CDATA[<p>I know that it’s Tuesday, which might not look like part of the weekend. However, this weekend was a long weekend and I had Monday and Tuesday off, so I think this counts as being part of the weekend.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to put together a reference document, tentatively named “Practical Convex Optimization,” that can act as a bit of prologue and/or reference document for work I’ve done in optimization theory. This has turned out to be a far larger endeavor than I expected, but here’s a draft: 
<img src="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxvvjwbmsvgw" alt="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxvvjwbmsvgw" /></p>

<h2 id="upcoming-week">Upcoming Week</h2>
<p><img src="assets/214216meme" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For some reason, my to-do list has a massive bulge in the 2/14-216 period. It’s some sort of weird magnet for things to handle that defies logic – @RogerPenrose you might want to take a look at this, could inspire a new physics or something.</p>

<p>There’s some human things</p>
<ul>
  <li>A couple of election statements</li>
  <li>A prefect application</li>
  <li>A school meeting announcement for a Wordle Tournament (!)</li>
  <li>Valentine’s Day</li>
</ul>

<p>But then there’s also the F=ma and AIME. By some unlucky coincidence, Choate is doing both the F=ma B and AIME 2, which means that they’re on back to back days.</p>

<p>This is technically pretty likely – both {A &amp; 1} and {B &amp; 2} cause this to happen – but I feel like most schools are doing {B &amp; 1} which is significantly nicer.</p>

<h2 id="aime-and-how-the-imo-tst-process-works">AIME and how the IMO TST Process Works</h2>
<p>AIME is terrifying because it’s the first of two make-or-break contests, the second being USAMO 2022, for entering the TST process for IMO 2023.</p>

<p>The IMO TST process is complicated, see <a href="https://blog.evanchen.cc/2020/11/10/usa-special-team-selection-test-series-for-imo-2021/">Evan Chen’s Explanation of the 2021 IMO TST</a>. This year it’s also slightly different because of Covid, so perhaps there is some value in me writing an explanation of this year’s process too because the only people who understand it seem to be the people who have qualified for the process and learn it by doing it.</p>

<p>Regardless, the AIME is pretty damn important if I want to make the IMO. I need a 11 out of 15 to be safe (which would give a 240.5 USAMO index). This should be fine since I got a 14 last year – but I also spent a large chunk of my winter last year vibing to music and math.</p>

<h2 id="fma">F=ma</h2>
<p>As for F=ma, I probably won’t prep too much, maybe one or two practice sets. I qualified last year by the slimmest of margins, getting exactly the cutoff score only after they accepted a second answer for a broken problem. I don’t have high hopes for F=ma, but I’ll probably try to make time because a second USAPhO qualification would be pretty cool. Still, I care <em>much</em> more about qualifying for USAMO because I can actually do well on USAMO, not so much for USAPhO.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to be more punctual about next week’s blog post, I think it’ll be on treating school like a day job (which \(\neq\) slacking).</p>

<p>Logistically, I’ll also mention that I’m going to add the date to the titles of all of my blog posts, as well as these nice “previous” and “next” buttons that let you move through posts on Wordpress.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update," /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that it’s Tuesday, which might not look like part of the weekend.

However, since we uploaded to Arxiv at 10pm on Friday, and the verification process is slower over the weekends, I still don’t have a nice arxiv link to put in the post.</p>

<p>More importantly though, Wordpress doesn’t have LaTeX functionality, which makes any attempt at explaining math beyond arithmetic an extremely painful endeavor…</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to write a Life Update, the second half of which will kinda be about the paper because it was <em>the</em> thing that I worked on and thought about in the week before the Jan 27 (AOE midnight) deadline.</p>

<p>I’ve also set up a mailing list, so if you enter your email into the “subscribe to our newsletter” form on the main page I’ll email you each time I post.</p>

<h2 id="week-3-sun-116---sat-122">Week 3: Sun 1/16 - Sat 1/22</h2>
<p>Hours: 9:40 (U), 10:00 (M), 9:30 (T), 12:35 (W), 10:00 (R), 13:00 (F), 10:10 (S)</p>

<p>For the first half of the week, I was still somewhat recovering from getting sick (which you can read about it in my previous life update). The period from Monday to Thursday was a delightful return to normal. After being sick for a week, and suffering through the accompanied decrease in quality of life, it was amazing being back to normal. I promised myself that I would appreciate my regained health, and I did. All in all, I lost ten pounds (mostly water) through the process. However, getting sick was a net positive on my mental health (?). It was a forced break where I didn’t think about complicated things – I thought a lot about god and pain.</p>

<p>Beginning on Friday though, the ICML paper grind began. It’s amazing how the days can be filled up; that day, I went to my Friday classes, winter rowing, ran physics club, made an amazing poster w/ Deven Huang, and then spent the rest of the night trying to solve the fact that I did not have a full convergence proof for our ICML submission.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the only thing I did was work on the paper, and this mainly took the form of me rereading papers. Throughout the entire process, I mainly referenced three papers, and I’ll reveal them in my full post about the paper. :)</p>

<h2 id="week-4-sun-123---sat-129">Week 4: Sun 1/23 - Sat 1/29</h2>
<p>Hours: 10:00 (U), 14:20 (M), 12:00 (T), 13:30 (W), 13:35 (R), 9:10 (F), 8:30 (S)</p>

<p>There are very few times in my logs when I was not-resting for more than 14 hours. Those were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2/18/2021 (14:30): Making my first ever podcast</li>
  <li>3/1/2020 (14:00): Doing a USACO on a Monday</li>
  <li>6/17/2021 (14:40): Taking AP CSA and then an official MOP Mock IMO, with Greenish in the afternoon</li>
</ul>

<p>Hitting 14 hours is a momentous occasion. After all, 14 hours + 8 hours of sleep + 3 hours of life essentials requires 100% efficiency plus a little extra.</p>

<p>The period from Monday to Thursday when I made the most progress on the paper. I made an observation that put me in the right direction on Thursday at 10:30am while in Physics class, and then made the crucial observation at around 11:30am while in a SAC study room with DH. Thankfully, by some miracle, I didn’t have too much homework this week. Or maybe since I was sleeping less and had on average 13 hours of working time on my hands each day the homework load seemed really light.</p>

<p>I also think that I’ve mastered the art of handling midnight AOE times as an East coast person. Thursday at 11:59pm in AOE time is equal to Friday at 7am in EST time, so the technique I’ve used in my past two paper deadlines is to sleep from ~2:30 AM - ~5:00 AM. This is the perfect timing because you get a long block of time until 2:30 AM, and then wake up with a fresh mind, sync up with your collaborators, and then do a final 1.5 hours of grammar checking and higher quality edits since you’re slightly less sleep-deprived.</p>

<p>On Friday after submitting at 7am, I slept from 7:00-8:30 since I didn’t have classes until 9:20 AM. I got through classes and sports with only one person, HD, remarking about me looking tired, which I think is a great endorsement of the 2:45am - 5:15am nap as opposed to a full all-nighter. I took Friday night off, watched movies with C, went to the Lunar Banquet, and got home to Easton around 10pm, where I worked on the Arxiv version until 12:30am and then went to sleep. I slept in until noon on Saturday.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>While I lucked out and there wasn’t too much homework last week, God’s compensating for that this week.</p>

<p>I have</p>
<ul>
  <li>a presentation on the Froude number</li>
  <li>a history essay</li>
  <li>an English essay</li>
  <li>a personal narrative for my college counselor.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pretty excited though, if I can stay as efficient as I was in the week before the ICML deadline, I should be able to handle everything. Contestwise, I skipped USACO this weekend because I just didn’t have enough time, and AIME is terrifyingly only two weeks away.</p>

<p>Remarkably, this post only took 1 hour, and I really should get back to homework.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update," /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I originally planned on writing out a full explanation of the research in the paper that we submitted to ICML last Friday.
