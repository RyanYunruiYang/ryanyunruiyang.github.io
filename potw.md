Welcome to the POTW! This ran for around a year in 2022, and I'm in the process of importing the past statements in, and building a second set of sites which will contain solutions that will be click-into-able-in-a-link-under-the-problem-statement (hopefully).


## Problems

### 31. Mathematics (Peyton Li and Ryan Yang). Difficulty 3.
Let X = (1-1/2)(1-1/4)(1-1/8)(1-1/16)(1-1/32)(1-1/64)(1-1/128)….. = prod_{n=1}^{infty} (1- 0.5^n).
You can easily get an upper bound by computing a few terms, but getting a lower bound is much harder. Find a lower bound on X and you will be scored based on the strength of the lower bound:
- X>0: 2 points
- X>=63/256: 3 points
- X>=1/4: 4 points
- X>=9/32: 5 points

You can use a calculator, but I’ll just tell you that X is approximately 0.28878.

*Remark (where this problem came from): In F_2, the probability that a NxN matrix with randomly selected entries is invertible is prod_{n=1}^{N} (1- 0.5^n)*


### 1. Linguistics (David Garsten, adapted from Doris L Payne). Difficulty 3.
Tone is very important in the East African language Maasai. Vowels written with an acúte accent have high tone, those with a gràve accent have low tone, and those without an accent have mid tone. (Pronunciation guide: ɔ = “awe”, ɛ = “let”, ɪ = “bit”, ʊ = “hood”, ŋ = “song”)

Here are some sentences in Maasai:\\
1) éósh ɔlmʊraní ɔlásʊráɪ̀\\
2) áadɔ́l ɔlasʊráɪ́\\
3) áaósh ɔlmʊraní\\
4) ɪ́dɔ́l ɔlmʊránì\\
5) íóshokí ɔlmʊránì ɔlásʊráɪ̀\\
6) ádúŋokí ɔlmʊránì ɔlcɛtá\\
7) ádúŋ ɔlcɛtá\\
8) áaduŋokí ɔlmʊraní ɔlcɛtá\\
9) áadúŋ ɔlmʊraní\\
10) édúŋ ɔlmʊraní

Match them to their English translations:\\
A) The warrior cuts me.\\
B) The warrior cuts the tree for me.\\
C) The warrior cuts it.\\
D) I cut the tree for the warrior.\\
E) The warrior hits me.\\
F) You see the warrior.\\
G) The warrior hits the snake.\\
H) The snake sees me.\\
I) You hit the snake for the warrior.\\
J) I cut the tree.
