Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang and I'm an undergrad at MIT. Feel free to check out my blog or peruse some of the things Ive done in past lives.

My primary intellectual backgrounds have been in mathematics, where I was ~15-20th in USAMO and US IMO Team Selection Tests; and computer science and distributed systems where I've been published in IEEE and ACM and am working at the birthplace of the world wide web this summer.

Beyond that, my passionate distraction from the above topics is compulsively buying books from used book stores, where I love reading history, sci-fi, politics, linguistics, politics, and seek to devour as many books as possible ([goodreads.com/ryanyang](goodreads.com/ryanyang)).

Outside of these things, I love [crossword fencing](https://downforacross.com/), reading Buddhist theology, baseball sabermetrics, skateboarding, venturing-beyond-Jane-Street-T-shirts-into-real-fashion, the NYTimes, and Home Depot.
