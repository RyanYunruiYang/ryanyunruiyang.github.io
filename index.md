Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang-Liu and I'm a freshman at MIT. This website largely serves as an artifact of, and archive for, my past lives.

My primary intellectual backgrounds have been in mathematics, where I competed in final round US IMO Team Selection Tests, and CS (AI and distributed systems) where I've been published in IEEE and ACM.

Beyond that, my passionate distraction from real work is compulsively buying books from used book stores -- where I seek to devour as much history, sci-fi, politics, linguistics, and theology as possible ([goodreads.com/ryanyang](https://goodreads.com/ryanyang)). Outside of these things, I also love [crossword fencing](https://downforaacross.com/fencing), the Atlantic, jiu-jitsu, twitter, Buddhist and Islamic theology, baseball sabermetrics, skateboarding, ancient Greek and Roman history, venturing-beyond-Jane-Street-T-shirts-into-real-fashion, and Home Depot.
