Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang-Liu and I'm a freshman at MIT. This website largely serves as an artifact of and archive for my past lives.

My primary intellectual backgrounds have been in mathematics, where I was ~15-20th in USAMO and US IMO Team Selection Tests; and computer science and distributed systems where I've been published in IEEE and ACM.

Beyond that, my passionate distraction from the above topics is compulsively buying books from used book stores, where I love reading history, sci-fi, politics, linguistics, politics, and seek to devour as many books as possible ([goodreads.com/ryanyang](https://goodreads.com/ryanyang)).

Outside of these things, I love [crossword fencing](https://downforacross.com/fencing), reading Buddhist theology, baseball sabermetrics, skateboarding, venturing-beyond-Jane-Street-T-shirts-into-real-fashion, the NYTimes, and Home Depot.
