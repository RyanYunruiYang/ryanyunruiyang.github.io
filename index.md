Welcome to my website! I'm Ryan Yang and I'm an undergrad at MIT. Feel free to check out my blog or peruse some of the things Ive done in past lives.

My primary intellectual background is in mathematics, where I was ~15-20th in USAMO and US IMO Team Selection Tests, and computer science (mainly networks) where I've been published in IEEE and ACM and am working at CERN this summer.

Beyond that, my passionate distraction from the above topics is compulsively buying books from used book stores, where I love reading history, sci-fi, politics, linguistics, politics, and seek to devour as many books as possible (goodreads.com/ryanyang).

Outside of these things, I love crossword fencing, reading Buddhist theology, baseball sabermetrics, skateboarding, dressing formally for no reason, the NYTimes, and Home Depot.
